# lox

Another implementation of the Lox language from the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

This isn't a direct translation of the book's code into Rust, but rather a personal attempt to recreate the language, using the book as a guiding resource.

This lox variant borrows heavily from [dada](https://github.com/dada-lang/dada), a language I think whose code is very well written. 

Lox is a toy that I enjoy playing with, but feel free to join in and make it your toy too. We can even collaborate to make it even better.
